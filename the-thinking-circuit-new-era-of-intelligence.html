                                        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decision-making. Already it is transforming every walk of life. The daily lives of people are increasingly filled with the presence of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

                                        <p>This technology is no longer found solely in the realm of science fiction but is insinuating itself in all aspects of our lives, from the simple presence of smartphones in our pockets to the complex guiding hands behind our online experiences. Welcome to <b>â€œThe Thinking Circuit: A New Wave of Intelligence,"</b> where we will attempt to unravel the mystique surrounding AI and understand its major impacts on society.</p>

                                        <h3>The birth of AI: From theory to practice</h3>

                                        <p>The idea of automata goes back centuries, and the legends of ancient Greece certainly featured them. Early thinkers talked about creating artificial beings, and their ideas were precursors to the phenomenon we call artificial intelligence. However, the concept really came into being in the 20th century.</p>

                                        <p>It was during this era that mathematics and computing science laid the true foundation for the kind of <b>"Thinking machines"</b> present in early and mid-20th-century imaginations. <b>Alan Turing</b> proposed his famous (or perhaps infamous) test in 1950; during the conference at Dartmouth College in 1956, <b>John McCarthy</b> coined the term "artificial intelligence."</p>
